## Overview
The **WizardMorat** is a Kotlin-based application designed to compute and track scores for the popular card game, Wizard. This app simplifies scorekeeping, ensuring an enjoyable and seamless gaming experience.

## The Funny Story Behind the App
One evening, during a particularly intense game of Wizard with friends, we realized that keeping track of scores was becoming a bit chaotic. Amidst the laughter and friendly banter, someone jokingly suggested, "Wouldn't it be great if we had an app to do this for us?" That sparked an idea, and after a few more rounds (and a lot of laughs), the concept for the Wizard Score Calculator was born. What started as a joke turned into a fun project that we hope will make your game nights just as enjoyable!
